                    We are the dinner club. An exclusive group of professional bakers with absolutely no background training or skill. Let me
                    introduce you to our members. First we have master chef Kirsten (NOT Kristen). Without her there would
                    be no dinner club, or at least no food at dinner club. Next we have Brian, he is the spice master. His
                    favorite ingredient, and in his opinion the only one worth using, is onion. Next we have the hosts Nathan
                    and Kathryn. They lovingly provide their kitchen and moral support needed to accomplish these great cooking
                    feats.
